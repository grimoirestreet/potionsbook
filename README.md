## Difficulty Guidelines

The difficulty system corresponds to Hogwarts year levels and brewing complexity:

- **Elementary**: Years 1-2 students can brew safely
  - Basic potions with simple ingredients
  - Minimal brewing complexity
  - Low danger if mistakes are made
  - Examples: Cure for Boils, Hair-Raising Potion

- **Intermediate**: Years 3-5 students can attempt
  - Moderate complexity requiring more skill
  - Some dangerous ingredients or precise timing
  - Mistakes can cause mild harm or potion failure
  - Examples: Calming Draught, Shrinking Solution

- **Advanced**: Years 6-7 students (Advanced level classes)
  - Complex brewing requiring significant skill
  - Dangerous ingredients or precise techniques
  - Mistakes can cause serious harm
  - Some require special authorization even for advanced students
  - Examples: Polyjuice Potion, Veritaserum

- **Master**: Faculty and trained adults only
  - Extremely complex or dangerous to brew
  - Requires extensive magical knowledge and experience
  - Potentially lethal if brewed incorrectly
  - Often illegal for students to possess
  - Examples: Felix Felicis, Draught of Living Death

### Year Level Correlation:
- **Years 1-2**: Elementary only
- **Years 3-5**: Elementary + Intermediate  
- **Years 6-7**: Elementary + Intermediate + Advanced
- **Post-graduation/Faculty**: All levels including Master

When adding potions, match the difficulty to both the brewing complexity and the appropriate age/skill level for safety.

## Adding a New Potion

## Player-Created Potions

1. Add them to the **"Player‚ÄëCreated Potions"** category
2. Include detailed approval notes in the `"notes"` field
3. Credit the creating player in the `"inventor"` field

## Editing Existing Potions

1. Find the potion in the appropriate category in `potions-data.json`
2. Click the pencil icon to edit
3. Modify any of the fields as needed
4. Commit your changes

## Important Notes

- **Always add a comma** after the previous entry before adding your new one
- **Don't add a comma** after your new entry if it's the last one in that category
- **Check your JSON formatting** - the site will break if there are syntax errors
- **Use straight quotes** (`"`) not curly quotes (`"`)
- **Keep difficulty levels consistent** with the year restrictions

## Troubleshooting

If the site breaks after your changes:
1. Check for missing commas between entries
2. Ensure all quotes are properly closed
3. Verify brackets `{}` are properly matched
4. Look for any special characters that might need escaping
5. Make sure you're adding to the correct category

The site will automatically update within a few minutes of committing your changes to GitHub!
