## Important Notes

- **Always add a comma** after the previous entry before adding your new one
- **Don't add a comma** after your new entry if it's the last one in that category
- **Check your JSON formatting** - the site will break if there are syntax errors
- **Use straight quotes** (`"`) not curly quotes (`"`)
- **Keep difficulty levels consistent** with the year restrictions

## Difficulty Guidelines

The difficulty system corresponds to Hogwarts year levels and brewing complexity:

- **Elementary**: Years 1-2 students can brew safely
  - Basic potions with simple ingredients
  - Minimal brewing complexity
  - Low danger if mistakes are made
  - Examples: Cure for Boils, Hair-Raising Potion

- **Intermediate**: Years 3-5 students can attempt
  - Moderate complexity requiring more skill
  - Some dangerous ingredients or precise timing
  - Mistakes can cause mild harm or potion failure
  - Examples: Calming Draught, Shrinking Solution

- **Advanced**: Years 6-7 students (Advanced level classes)
  - Complex brewing requiring significant skill
  - Dangerous ingredients or precise techniques
  - Mistakes can cause serious harm
  - Some require special authorization even for advanced students
  - Examples: Polyjuice Potion, Veritaserum

- **Master**: Faculty and trained adults only
  - Extremely complex or dangerous to brew
  - Requires extensive magical knowledge and experience
  - Potentially lethal if brewed incorrectly
  - Often illegal for students to possess
  - Examples: Felix Felicis, Draught of Living Death

### Year Level Correlation:
- **Years 1-2**: Elementary only
- **Years 3-5**: Elementary + Intermediate  
- **Years 6-7**: Elementary + Intermediate + Advanced
- **Post-graduation/Faculty**: All levels including Master

When adding potions, match the difficulty to both the brewing complexity and the appropriate age/skill level for safety.
